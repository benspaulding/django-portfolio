===================================
 Web Worker’s Portfolio for Django
===================================

If you have more than just a few projects (design, code, or both) you may find
this app useful. I think it works, but I wouldn’t know — I am currently failing
at keeping a portfolio together.

Django_ 1.0 or later is required.

TODO
----

1. Write tests.
2. Write Spanish translation (just for fun).
