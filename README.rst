If you have more than just a few projects (design, code, or both) you may find
this app useful. I would show you an example of it in action, but I do not have
an up-to-date portfolio. (But I have used this in the past.)

Requirements
------------

* Python_ 2.7 or 3.3
* Django_ 1.4.2 or 1.5
* Pillow_

TODO
----

1. Add ``__version__`` to package/setup.py.
2. Add ability for multiple images per project. Likely something like a
   new model and relation that would allow for arbitrary numbers or images.
3. Fix non-deterministic ordering issue on objects with nullable dates.
4. Add search index for Haystack.
5. Write admin action tests.
6. List on PyPI.
