===================================
 Web Workerâ€™s Portfolio for Django
===================================

If you have more than just a few projects (design, code, or both) you may find
this app useful. I would show you an example of it in action, but I do not have
an up-to-date portfolio. (But I have used this in the past.)

Python_ 2.6 or newer and Django_ 1.4 or newer are required.

TODO
----

1. Write tests.
