===================================
 Web Workerâ€™s Portfolio for Django
===================================

If you have more than just a few projects (design, code, or both) you may find
this app useful. I would show you an example of it in action, but I am currently
failing at keeping a portfolio together. (But I have used this in the past.)

Django_ 1.0 or later is required.

TODO
----

1. Write tests.
2. Write Spanish translation (just for fun).
